          I am a software developer with approximately three years of professional
experience, having contributed to various projects by taking responsibility beyond
development tasks. Alongside technical work, I value structured progress, process
tracking, and effective collaboration within teams. I focus on ownership,
accountability, and delivering results in a consistent and reliable manner.
Through both in-house and freelance projects, I have gained experience working
with different team structures and adapting to diverse working environments. My
background is primarily focused on backend and database-oriented development,
while my previous mobile development experience allows me to approach products
from a more holistic perspective. I am eager to continue learning and growing as a
developer, both technically and professionally.
